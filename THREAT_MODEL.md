# Group Chat AI
## Application Info
This is a real-time conversational AI platform enabling users to practice presentations with multiple AI personas. Features include WebSocket communication, voice synthesis, image uploads, custom persona creation, and AWS Bedrock integration for LLM processing.

## Architecture
### Introduction
**Group Chat Architecture Overview:**

1. **Frontend Layer**: React application served via Amazon CloudFront with S3 static hosting, supporting real-time WebSocket connections and image uploads
2. **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito User Pool with OAuth 2.0/OIDC for secure user management
3. **Network Security**: VPC architecture with ALB restricted to CloudFront IP ranges, private subnets for backend services
4. **Backend Services**: ECS Fargate hosting Express.js server with WebSocket support, ConversationOrchestrator, PersonaManager, and SessionService
5. **AI Integration**: Amazon Bedrock for LLM processing (Claude models), AWS Polly for voice synthesis with persona-specific voices
6. **Configuration**: Parameter Store for centralized configuration, CloudWatch for comprehensive monitoring and logging
